# Calculator

I design this app to perform simple calculation. There is no unit converter, you can
copy the result or formula to clipboard by long pressing it.

The text color of the widget can be customized, as well as the color and the alpha
of the background. Press the result or formula in the widget to open the app.

Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. It is fully opensource, provides
customizable colors.
